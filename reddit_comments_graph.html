She has historically espoused regressive positions that landed hundreds of thousands of Americans in jail, and she was a gravely incompetent secretary of State who, under other little things, damned a whole nation (Syria) to complete destruction by funding what today is ISIS, and didn\u0027t denounce the KSA and Turkey which support it. Clinton was a poor candidate because she was a regressive hawk, largely indistinguishable from a Cheney. Her track record is there completely independently of Cheeto Jesus.\n\nTrump got elected because his very one talent is exploiting the media to his advantage, and in the America who votes it\u0027s still paramount to be on the media all day. The election of Trump is also inconsequential by itself, because the cabinet has the same sorts of visages that would have been picked by Clinton.\n\nI was involved in the PSOE back in the days when I lived in Spain. When I entered the party, it was the main alternative to the corrupt regionalist party that has dominated the Canary Islands for the last 25 years now. There came a point where the party decided to not just not oppose those policies, but actually entering the cabinet with the regionalists and backing the same corruption that I wanted to banish. Obviously I\u0027m not a member of the PSOE anymore, but I feel that a similar process has apparently happened everywhere in Europe: the right has become gradually more corrupt and insularist and the left has abandoned the workers, migrants and the poor to help the right establish its policies.
